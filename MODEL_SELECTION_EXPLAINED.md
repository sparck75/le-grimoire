# 🎯 Model Selection: Admin vs User Control

## Your Question
> "I see the 3 models in the UI, but what happens if I select one? I thought this was hardcoded in the backend service from the .env. Can the admin really control which model we use in the backend or something we also give the user the option?"

Great question! Here's the complete explanation:

## ✅ What We Implemented

### Admin-Level Model Selection (Current Implementation)

**Who can change it:** Only **administrators** via the Admin AI Management page

**What happens when selected:**
1. Admin selects a model from dropdown (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
2. Frontend sends `POST /api/admin/ai/config` with `{ "model": "gpt-4o-mini" }`
3. Backend updates `settings.OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"` **in memory**
4. Next recipe extraction uses the new model immediately

**Scope:** System-wide - affects **all users** and **all recipe extractions**

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Flow Diagram
```
Admin selects model
    ↓
Frontend: POST /api/admin/ai/config { model: "gpt-4o-mini" }
    ↓
Backend: settings.OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini" (in memory)
    ↓
User uploads recipe image
    ↓
AIRecipeExtractionService reads settings.OPENAI_MODEL dynamically
    ↓
OpenAI API call with selected model
    ↓
Recipe extracted using that model
    ↓
Cost calculated based on model's pricing
```

### Before Our Fix (❌ Broken)
```python
class AIRecipeExtractionService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = settings.OPENAI_MODEL  # ❌ Set once at startup
    
    async def extract_recipe(self, image_path: str):
        # Uses self.model - NEVER changes even if admin updates settings!
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.model,  # ❌ Always uses startup value
            ...
        )
```

### After Our Fix (✅ Working)
```python
class AIRecipeExtractionService:
    def get_current_model(self) -> str:
        """Read settings dynamically"""
        return getattr(settings, 'OPENAI_MODEL', 'gpt-4o')
    
    async def extract_recipe(self, image_path: str):
        current_model = self.get_current_model()  # ✅ Reads settings NOW
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=current_model,  # ✅ Uses current selection
            ...
        )
```

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### 1. Changes Are Not Persistent
- ❌ Changes only exist **in memory**
- ❌ **Lost on server restart**
- ✅ To persist: Update `.env` file manually

**Example:**
```bash
# .env file
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # ← Change this for permanent effect
```

### 2. System-Wide Only
- ❌ Cannot have different users use different models
- ✅ One model for entire application

### 3. Requires Admin Access
- ❌ Regular users cannot select models
- ✅ Only admins via `/admin/ai` page

---

## 🎭 User-Level Model Selection (Not Implemented)

### What This Would Look Like
If we wanted **users** to choose models when extracting recipes:

```typescript
// Frontend: Recipe upload form
<select name="ai_model">
  <option value="gpt-4o">GPT-4o ($2.50/$10) - Best quality</option>
  <option value="gpt-4o-mini">GPT-4o Mini ($0.15/$0.60) - Fast & cheap</option>
  <option value="gpt-4-turbo">GPT-4 Turbo ($10/$30) - Premium</option>
</select>

// User sees cost before extraction
<div>Estimated cost: $0.02 - $0.08 per recipe</div>
```

```python
# Backend: Extract with user-selected model
@router.post("/extract")
async def extract_recipe(
    file: UploadFile,
    model: str = Form("gpt-4o")  # User's choice
):
    result = await ai_service.extract_recipe(
        image_path=filepath,
        model=model  # ← Pass user's selection
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Users can choose cost vs quality
- ✅ Budget-conscious users can use cheaper models
- ✅ Premium users can use best models

**Challenges:**
- ❌ More complex billing/tracking
- ❌ Need per-user cost limits
- ❌ More UI complexity

## 📊 Current Model Options

### Vision-Capable Models (Shown in UI)
Only these 3 appear because recipe extraction requires image analysis:

| Model | Input | Output | Quality | Speed | Use Case |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| **gpt-4o** ⭐ | $2.50/1M | $10/1M | Excellent | Fast | Best overall |
| **gpt-4o-mini** ⭐ | $0.15/1M | $0.60/1M | Good | Very fast | Cost-effective |
| **gpt-4-turbo** | $10/1M | $30/1M | Excellent | Medium | Previous gen |

### Non-Vision Models (Hidden)
These exist in the config but aren't shown (no image support):

| Model | Input | Output | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **o1-preview** | $15/1M | $60/1M | Reasoning, no vision |
| **o1-mini** | $3/1M | $12/1M | Fast reasoning, no vision |
| **gpt-3.5-turbo** | $0.50/1M | $1.50/1M | Text only, no vision |

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Where Model Selection Happens

1. **Config Update** (`backend/app/api/admin_ai.py`):
```python
@router.post("/config")
async def update_ai_config(config: AIConfigUpdate):
    if config.model is not None:
        if config.model not in OPENAI_MODELS:
            raise HTTPException(400, "Invalid model")
        settings.OPENAI_MODEL = config.model  # ← Updates in memory
```

2. **Model Reading** (`backend/app/services/ai_recipe_extraction.py`):
```python
async def extract_recipe(self, image_path: str):
    current_model = self.get_current_model()  # ← Reads from settings
    response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
        model=current_model,  # ← Uses current setting
        ...
    )
```

3. **Cost Calculation** (`backend/app/api/ai_extraction.py`):
```python
from app.core.openai_models import calculate_cost

# Dynamically calculates based on actual model used
cost = calculate_cost(
    log_entry.model_name,      # ← Model from extraction log
    log_entry.prompt_tokens,
    log_entry.completion_tokens
)
```

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Current Setup (Admin-Only)
**Best for:**
- ✅ Single organization/family
- ✅ Controlled costs
- ✅ Consistent quality
- ✅ Simple management

**Perfect if:**
- Admin manages costs centrally
- All users get same experience
- You want predictable billing

### Future: User-Level Selection
**Best for:**
- ✅ Multi-tenant systems
- ✅ Freemium models (free=mini, paid=4o)
- ✅ User cost control
- ✅ Flexible pricing

**Consider if:**
- Different users have different needs
- Want to offer tiered service
- Users pay for their own usage

## 💡 Summary

**Current Answer to Your Question:**

> **"Can the admin really control which model we use?"**

✅ **Yes!** Admin can switch models in real-time via UI:
- Changes apply **immediately** to all extractions
- Model selection is **dynamic** (reads from `settings.OPENAI_MODEL` each time)
- Changes affect **all users** system-wide
- ⚠️ Changes are **not persistent** (lost on restart unless .env is updated)

> **"Or should we give users the option?"**

🤔 **Not currently implemented, but possible:**
- Would require passing `model` parameter through extraction API
- Would need per-user billing tracking
- Would add UI complexity (model selector on upload form)
- Best suited for multi-tenant or freemium scenarios

**For most use cases (family/personal recipe manager), admin-level control is sufficient!**
